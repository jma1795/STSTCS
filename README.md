## Description from original Website

This is a computer conversion of an FASA's board game, Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator. It's a 2D turn-based strategy game in which you take control of a starship and proceed to attempt to destroy other starships before they destroy you. The game can be played by multiple humans (in "hot seat" mode) or against computer-controlled opponents. Editors are integrated into the game so users can customize the provided ships and scenarios or add completely new ones. Additional sounds and bitmaps can also be added. A typical game lasts from 5-10 minutes for a one-on-one scenario, to about an hour or more for scenarios with over 10 ships.
The game requires Windows 95/98/2000/XP.

## My notes:
Alot of this game’s files are still hosted and available at Trekcore – feel free to check them out. This is an open repo to keep the files backed up somewhere, as this truly is a fun and great way to play this game in computerized form. Unfortunately most of the geocities websites are down, leaving much to be desired in finding this game and its files. I've found it does work on more modern systems (and linux via wine) if you are able to install msvbvm50 first as it requires some runtimes from there. I've also included the setup for the STSTCS v205 Beta 3 Installer that adds some additional Beta features to the game such as cloaking and a few other items I can't recall, though it is slightly more unstable than the 204 version. I hope others enjoy this game as I have, as I do not want to see this project go away. If anyone knows where else this game is hosted please let me know! 

## Step 1: Installing required packages and enabling multilib
1. Install Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0
   `msvbvm50.exe`
2. Install  Starship Tactical Combat Simulator v2.05 beta
   `STSTCS.v205.Beta.3.Installer.exe`
4. Apply the Ship Counter Supplement & Romulan Standard Ship Pack for the full experience
   `STSTCS-ShipPack-RomulanStandard-v100.zip`
   `STSTCS-CounterSupplement-Set1.zip`
